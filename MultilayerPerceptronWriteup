AIM: To implement Multilayer Perceptron algorithm to simulate XOR gate.
Theory:
Multilayer Perceptron:
A Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) is a type of artificial neural network
used in machine learning and deep learning. It is a feedforward neural 
network with one or more layers of interconnected neurons, and it is one
of the simplest and most widely used neural network architectures.
MLP can be used to solve a variety of problems, including classification, 
regression, and pattern recognition. One of the simplest problems that an MLP
can solve is the XOR problem.
XOR GATE:
The XOR problem is a logical operation that takes two binary inputs and 
produces a single binary output. The output is 1 if and only if the two 
inputs are different.
