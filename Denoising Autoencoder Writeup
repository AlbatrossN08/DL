Aim: - To implement Autoencoder for Image 
Denoising application using MNIST dataset.
Thoery:
A Denoising Autoencoder is a type of autoencoder 
that is specifically trained to remove noise or 
corruption from input data. It is a variant of the
traditional autoencoder and is used for feature learning
and data reconstruction tasks when the input data is noisy or contains errors.

 
Steps:
1. Import the necessary libraries and load the MNIST dataset
2. Preprocess the dataset by reshaping the images into one
dimensional array and normalizing the pixel values.
3. Add noise to the training and test datasets.
4. Define a sequential model with a series of dense layers
5. Compile the model with mean squared error loss
function and the adam optimizer.
6. Train the model on the noisy training data 
for a specified number of epochs.
7. Use the trained model to predict the denoised
versions of the noisy test images
8. Compare the denoised images to the original
test images to see how well the
model was able to remove noise.
