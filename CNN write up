Aim: - To design and implement Convolutional Neural Network model for digit recognition
Application using MNIST dataset..
Theory:
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of artificial neural network
designed for processing and analyzing structured grid-like data,
such as images and video. CNNs have revolutionized the field of computer vision
and are widely used for tasks like image classification, object detection, 
facial recognition, and more. They are particularly effective at capturing 
local patterns and hierarchies of features within images.
Layers:
Input
Convolution
Activation function
Pooling layer
Fully Connected Layer
Output layer
 
Steps:
1. Imports necessary libraries.
2. Loads and preprocesses the MNIST dataset.
3. Creates a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.
4. Compiles the model.
5. Trains the model on the MNIST dataset.
6. Makes predictions on the test dataset and visualizes some results.
7. Evaluates the model's test loss and accuracy.
